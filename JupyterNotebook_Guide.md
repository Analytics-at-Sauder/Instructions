# Jupytor Notebook Quick Guide

In order to open the '.ipynb' file which is the jupytor notebook file, first you need to download the anaconda-Navigator which can be downloaded [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Also, Anaconda provides its own version of cheat sheet so I won't spend more time working on it. The cheat sheet of basic features of anaconda navigator can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/_downloads/9ee215ff15fde24bf01791d719084950/Anaconda-Starter-Guide.pdf).

## Open the file

After you sucessfully install the app on your device, you will find several apps available for you. What you want to open is the jupytor notebook app.

Then you will see the file browser which you will go and find out the file you want to edit. It is nothing different from open a microsfot doc, just click on the jupytor notebook file and the system will open for you.

## Additional help for people who are not familiar with git :Download the jupytor notebook from Github

First, you will see many different project repos in the broader repository(click on the picture to open the website if you are not part of the organization yet). The content creaters put the original version of jupytor notebook in those repos.

Then feel free to edit it. After you are finished with all the contents in the cell, press "control + return" if you are using mac os system /press "control + enter" if you are using windows to end editing.

When you are done with all the cells, make sure you save it before close.
